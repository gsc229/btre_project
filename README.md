# btre_project

I built this Python/Django app following Brad Traversy's Udemy course, Python Django Dev To Deployment. 
I'm rendering pages through Jinja templating engine. I wanted to try out different cloud platforms so I deployed this
app three different times on Heroku, Digitial Ocean and AWS.
